# Visual_detect_inDDDQN

These codes is for techincal experiment in visual detection with dueling Dueling Double Deep Q learning network (DDDQN) which would help for accelerate reinforcement learning process from detecion reward signal.

Requirement:

python3.0 and upper;

tensorflow==1.9.0;

gym==0.12.1;

numpy==1.15.4;

imageio==2.4.1;

scikit-image==0.14.1;

Run:

after pip install all prerequisite python library:

directly run DDDQL_visualdetect_extraQ.py in python IDE (DDDQL_original.py is original DDDQL network).

or in command line:

python DDDQL_visualdetect_extraQ.py
